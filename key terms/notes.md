# ðŸ“Œ What is a Function Prototype?

## In C, a function prototype is like a "preview" or "announcement" of a function. It tells the compiler:

The name of the function,
What type of value it returns (like a number, text, etc.),
What type of inputs (arguments) it expects.
But â€” and this is important â€” a prototype does not include the actual code (the "body") of the function. It just gives the structure.

ðŸ”¤ Basic Syntax
A function prototype looks like this:

return_type function_name(type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2, ...);
For example:

int add(int a, int b);
Letâ€™s break this down:

int â†’ the function will return an integer.
add â†’ the name of the function.
(int a, int b) â†’ it takes two inputs, both integers, named a and b.
The semicolon ; â†’ this ends the line, because itâ€™s just a declaration, not the full function.
ðŸ§  Why Do We Need Prototypes?
In C, the compiler reads your code from top to bottom. So if you try to use a function before the compiler has seen it, it gets confused.

Hereâ€™s an example of a problem:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);  // ERROR: Compiler doesn't know 'add' yet!
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

This might cause a warning or error because main() calls add() before add() is defined.

âœ… Solution: Use a prototype at the top!

#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype - tells the compiler: "add() exists!"
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);  // Now it's OK!
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Full function definition (body)
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

Now the compiler knows about add() before itâ€™s used.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Points (Summary)
Concept	Explanation
Purpose	Helps the compiler check if you're using a function correctly (right number and types of arguments).
Placement	Usually written at the top of the file, after #include lines.
Semicolon	Prototypes end with ; â€” they donâ€™t have { } or code inside.
Not Required	If you define the full function before you use it, you donâ€™t need a prototype. But itâ€™s good practice to use one.
Header Files	In bigger programs, prototypes are often placed in .h files so multiple .c files can use them.
âœ… Example with No Return Value
Some functions donâ€™t return anything. We use void:

void greet(char name[]);  // Prototype: function called 'greet' that takes a string

ðŸ§© Think of It Like a Contract
A function prototype is like saying:

"Hey compiler, I promise there will be a function called add that takes two integers and returns an integer. Donâ€™t panic when you see it used â€” itâ€™s coming!"

ðŸ’¡ Final Tip
Even as a beginner, getting used to writing prototypes (or placing functions above main()) will help you avoid confusion and errors as your programs grow.
